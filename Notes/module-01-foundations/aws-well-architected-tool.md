## Overview

The AWS Well-Architected Tool (AWS WA Tool) is a self-service tool that helps you review and measure the state of your workloads against the latest AWS architectural best practices.

It is used to identify risks, apply best practices, and track architectural improvements over time.

## Workloads

A workload identifies a set of components that deliver business value.

Examples include:
- Marketing websites
- Ecommerce websites
- Mobile application backends
- Analytics platforms

Workloads can vary in architectural complexity:
- Simple workloads (e.g., static websites)
- Complex workloads (e.g., microservices architectures with multiple data stores)

Within a workload, you identify:
- Review Owner
- Environment
- Regions
- Account IDs

---

## Milestones

Milestones mark key changes in the architecture as it evolves throughout the product lifecycle, including:
- Design
- Testing
- Go live
- Production

---

## Lenses

Lenses provide a way to consistently measure architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.

- AWS provides lenses based on the Well-Architected Framework pillars
- Custom lenses can be created and used
- Shared lenses from others can also be applied

If a question does not apply to a specific workload, it can be disabled.

## Risk Identification

### High-Risk Issues (HRIs)

High-risk issues are architectural and operational choices that may result in significant negative impact to a business.

These risks can affect:
- Organizational operations
- Assets
- Individuals

### Medium-Risk Issues (MRIs)

Medium-risk issues are architectural and operational choices that may negatively impact the business, but to a lesser extent than high-risk issues.
