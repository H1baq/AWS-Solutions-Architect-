**AWS Shared Responsibility Model**

When you work with the AWS Cloud, managing security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. To depict this shared responsibility, AWS created the shared responsibility model. The distinction of responsibility is commonly referred to as security of the cloud as compared to security in the cloud.

**AWS Responsibility**

AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This means that AWS protects and secures the infrastructure that runs the services offered in the AWS Cloud. AWS is responsible for the following:

Protecting and securing AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and data centers, down to the physical security of the buildings

Managing the hardware, software, and networking components that run AWS services, such as the physical servers, host operating systems, virtualization layers, and AWS networking components

The level of responsibility that AWS has depends on the service. AWS classifies services into two categories. The following table provides information about each, including the AWS responsibility.

**Customer Responsibility**

Customers are responsible for security in the cloud. When using any AWS service, the customer is responsible for properly configuring the service and their applications, in addition to ensuring that their data is secure.

The customers' level of responsibility depends on the AWS service. Some services require the customer to perform all the necessary security configuration and management tasks.
Other more abstracted services require customers to only manage the data and control access to their resources. Using the two categories of AWS services, customers can determine their level of responsibility for each AWS service that they use.
