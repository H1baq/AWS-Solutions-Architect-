# AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Overview

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach for evaluating cloud architectures against AWS best practices.

It documents a set of foundational questions that help determine whether an architecture aligns well with modern cloud design principles and identifies areas that require remediation.

The framework is used to:
- Learn
- Measure
- Improve cloud architectures over time

## Why Use the AWS Well-Architected Framework

- **Build and deploy faster**  
  Reduce emergency response and capacity management through automation, enabling faster experimentation and releases.

- **Lower or mitigate risks**  
  Identify architectural risks early and address them before they impact the business.

- **Make informed decisions**  
  Highlight architectural decisions and understand how they affect business outcomes.

- **Learn AWS best practices**  
  Apply proven practices derived from reviewing thousands of AWS architectures.

AWS Well-Architected is a **risk quantification tool** used to evaluate and improve cloud workloads.

## Six Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework

### 1. Operational Excellence
The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

### 2. Reliability
The ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when expected.

Reliable systems should:
- Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions

### 3. Security
The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

### 4. Performance Efficiency
The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintain efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

### 5. Cost Optimization
The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

### 6. Sustainability
The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload.

Maximize the benefits from provisioned resources while minimizing the total resources required.

## Purpose of the Framework

The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides mechanisms to:
- Evaluate cloud architectures
- Identify risks
- Implement designs that scale with application needs

The framework is based on design principles and best practices that help build cloud systems that meet business and technical expectations.
